I created this project to improve my problem-solving and coding skills using JavaScript by answering code challenges. It will have answers for different platforms such as HackerRank, BeeCrowd, CodeWars and I will keep this project updated weekly.

This project was initially private, but I realized it could inspire others to practice with me! Additionally, I know it will help those who are training because they can check my code and see where they are making a mistake or how to answer a coding challenge that they couldn't before.

With this in mind, my primary objective is to inspire others to do the same and build a community of developers committed to continually evolving as students and professionals!
